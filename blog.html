      <h2>What is and is not Business Writing?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Is not meant to entertain or reflect; this is pleasure writing.</li>
        <li>Is meant to get facts straight and to the point, to inform or to persuade the reader.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Regular consistent practice is necessary. Changing habits is not easy; you have to be willing to change, know
        how to change, and practice. &quot;Practice makes perfect&quot;

      <h2>Principles of Business Writing</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Analyze the reader
          <ul>
            <li>What does my reader already know? Who is my audience?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Organize the message
          <ul>
            <li>
              Does your message begin with a purpose, organize the message in the best way for the reader, and look easy
              to read?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Signal the next step
          <ul>
            <li>Is there a time when a response is needed and does it contain contact information?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Value the reader
          <ul>
            <li>
              Effective business writers need to give the impression that the reader is important and not just another
              number.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure an effective message
          <ul>
            <li>Decrease the need for follow-up messages.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose the right channel
          <ul>
            <li>Email, Teams, Meeting, or Face to Face</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>The 10 C&#39;s of Business Writing</h2>
      <p>
        A writer has the right to expect every message to be: Complete, Concise, Clear, Conversational, Courteous,
        Correct, Considerate, Concrete, and Credible.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Complete: Is all of the information included so that follow-up questions are not necessary?</li>
        <li>
          Concise: Use the fewest number of words possible. Including more words into your writing leads the reader to
          have to wade through information that may not be relevant to the writing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clear: Have you thought about what the reader knows or doesn&#39;t know, or are you writing based on what you
          know and what makes sense to you?
        </li>
        <li>Conversational: Does your writing sound as if you are writing to a human or to a robot?</li>
        <li>
          Courteous: Is your tone pleasant? Have you shown the reader how they will benefit from your information or
          policy? Does the message sound demanding or is it all about the writer&#39;s interest?
        </li>
        <li>
          Correct: Is your writing accurate and professional, or does it give the impression that it was rushed and not
          prepared?
        </li>
        <li>Coherent: Does your writing look jumbled or do the ideas tie together smoothly?</li>
        <li>
          Considerate: Does your writing look inviting to read (using headings and bullets) or does it use 1 or 2 long
          paragraphs?
        </li>
        <li>Concrete: Have you included specifics and examples, or are vague meaningless words used?</li>
        <li>Credible: Are all facts within the article given from trusted sources and cited?</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Strong vs. Weak Verbs</h2>
      <p>Which of the following statements sound stronger and more concise?</p>
      <p>
        (a) You will need to send your confirmation for your appointment by Friday. (b) Please confirm your appointment
        by Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
        12 words versus 6 words. Not only is (b) stronger, the message is more concise. Look for camouflaged words in
        your message, verbs that have usually turned into nouns, commonly adding the -tion at the end of the word.
        Conversation versus confirm.
      </p>
      <p>The same principle applies for filler words.</p>
      <p>(a) There are five people who want to attend the meeting. (b) Five people want to attend the meeting.</p>
      <p>Make your writing more concise, cut out the fluff and get to the point.</p>
      <h2>Create a Clear Message</h2>
      <p>Understand your reader and their ability to comprehend what you&#39;re trying to tell them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What department do they work for?</li>
        <li>What is their experience within the topic you&#39;re talking about?</li>
        <li>What relationship do you have with the reader?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Make your message logical and easy to read for the reader. Your main idea should be at the top of the paragraph,
        utilize transitional words (first, second, although), consider the connotation of the words that you use.
      </p>
      <p>Example 1: &quot;Hey John, I need you to talk about something urgent when you have time.&quot;</p>
      <p>What would John think about in this message? What&#39;s so urgent?</p>
      <p>
        Example 2: &quot;Hey John, we need some help understanding the requirements in this ticket [link ticket here],
        specifically we have questions aboutâ€¦ [list your questions here]&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        In this 2nd message John knows exactly what ticket you&#39;re referring to, the exact questions you have, and
        knows to be prepared to answer these questions. Most of all, no worry about what exactly this urgent matter is.
      </p>
      <h2 id="cut-to-the-question">Cut to the Question</h2>
      <p>Inspired from: <a href="https://nohello.net/en/">https://nohello.net/en/</a></p>
      <p>
        If you are asking a question to a co-worker, ask the question. Letting the reader know exactly that you have a
        question will get an answer faster.
      </p>
      <p>Example 1: Bob: Hey John: How&#39;s it going? Bob: What time is the meeting? John: Oh, 3:30 today.</p>
      <p>
        This includes common opening phrases &quot;How are you?&quot; or &quot;Hey want to hop in a call?&quot;. Putting
        the reader on the spot dissecting a question in a call can make the recipient feel pressured to get the answer
        now. If you just ask the question first, you&#39;ll get the answer faster.
      </p>
      <p>Instead consider this:</p>
      <p>Example 2: Bob: Hey, what time is the meeting? John: Hey, 3:30 today.</p>
      <p>Straight to the point, no extra words or messages needed.</p>
      <h2 id="avoid-negative-words">Avoid Negative Words</h2>
      <p>Negative words can lead to negative reactions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;No&quot; and &quot;Not&quot;</li>
        <li>Reminders of a negative situation</li>
        <li>Doubtful words</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        How would you react if someone tells you &quot;You can&#39;t.&quot;, &quot;You won&#39;t be able to.&quot;,
        &quot;You failed.&quot;? Human nature is such that you immediately become defensive to language like this.
        Instead, you should focus on what is and can be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example 1: &quot;I won&#39;t be able to get to your review until Friday.&quot; Better: &quot;I will get to your
        review on Friday.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Example 2: &quot;You can&#39;t reserve Room 110 on June 10th.&quot; Better: &quot;Room 111 is already reserved
        for June 10th, but is available on the 9th or the 11th.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Phrase your writing to offer alternatives to phrases that are usually negative. Be assertive on the
        &#39;when&#39; something will happen or change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using positive language requires more thought, but is well worth the effort put in to better assist the reader.
      </p>
