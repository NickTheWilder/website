# Tic Tac Toe

Was sitting around reading and apparently tic tac toe has been solved. I always had a feeling about this. With perfect play, games should always end in a draw. Turns out [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy) and [white paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1207/s15516709cog1704_3) exist and are a pretty cool reads.

Nevertheless, here is minmax-ing all optimal plays. Try to go ahead and beat this program in tic tac toe, you can't btw.
