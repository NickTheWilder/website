# My Spotify Playlists

I have an obsession with creating playlists. Not sure when it started, but I'll hear a song of a niche genre and think "I want to hear more of that" and then create a new playlist based on that genre. I wanted to create a live document that organizes these songs.

I share these here in hopes that you find the same joy as music gives me :)
