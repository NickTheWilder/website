# Nothing changes if nothing changes

During my freshman year of university, in one of my intro to com sci classes, I became friends with a guy who was on the university's track team. I'd frequently ask him about working out and what he finds useful and not useful. Hopefully to get a "hack" that would help me. As everybody know it really just comes down to consistency and staying at it. But what about getting started on a project or starting towards achieving a goal? What's the hack there?

One day when bummed about my weight gain after going through a stressful point in life I asked him for advice. He said "Nothing changes if nothing changes". Corny, but it's the truth. Often times I'm starting at a blank screen, trying to drum up another cool idea to work on, or not being able to find the motivation to get outside and workout. 

Nothing changes if nothing changes.

I still frequently remind myself of this. I wrote his saying on a sticky note and pasted it to my monitor after my friend told me this. Removed it a few months later. Had to remind myself a few months after that. Rinse and repeat.

Here's me reminding myself of it again. 

It's a journey.
